  <p style="text-align: center;">Q: Why do I need to give my anilist username</p>
  <p> A: By providing your ANilist username, I am able to query your anilist data</p>
  <p>Q: Why do you need my anilist data</p>
  <p>A: In order to provide statistics that are as accurate as possible, being able to have data in the first place helps. This project is meant to project everyone who participates in swap, so by providing me with your data I am able to include them in the shown statistics!</p>
  <p>Q: Is this dangerous?</p>
  <P> A: Absolutely not. I respect your privacy and will not sell your data anywhere. More importantly the only data that I can access is public data, meaning anyone can see it anyway. Because of this it is 100% safe.</P>
  <p>Q: Why make this?</p>
  <P>A: I think it would be a wonderful thing for us to be able to check out what we make up as a community! I think being able to see what we've been up to could be a fun thing!</P>
