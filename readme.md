stuff that needs to be done:
  1. make query sql instead of json
  2. save deivated list
  3. change calculate logic order
  4. becauase we save the list, we can more easilt add or subtract other people and easily reacalcute it that way.
  so to explain 4, rn all you do is check if theirs new users, then pull their lists if so then calulate. but thats hella inefficent.
  what i should do is:
  the thing, but then as new users get added instead of caluclating everyone, just calcuilate them and parse their results with everyone else. i should also save the results somehow.
